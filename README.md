## Installation

To get started, you need to install the package via NuGet. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
dotnet add package Synapsers.MudBlazor.ThemeManager.Saver
```

Alternatively, you can find the package in the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

## Usage

After installing the package, you can start using the ThemeManager in your Blazor application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set it up:

1. **Add the necessary using directive**:

   ```csharp
   using Synapsers.MudBlazor.ThemeManager.Saver;
   ```

2. **Configure the ThemeManager in your `Startup.cs`**:

   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddMudServices();
       services.AddThemeManager();
   }
   ```

3. **Use the ThemeManager in your components**:

   You can now access the ThemeManager in your Blazor components. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

   ```razor
   @inject IThemeManager ThemeManager

   <MudThemeProvider Theme="@ThemeManager.CurrentTheme">
       <MudButton @onclick="SaveTheme">Save Theme</MudButton>
   </MudThemeProvider>

   @code {
       private void SaveTheme()
       {
           ThemeManager.SaveCurrentTheme();
       }
   }
   ```

This example demonstrates how to inject the `IThemeManager` and use it to save the current theme. You can further explore the API for more advanced features.
